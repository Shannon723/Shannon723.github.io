This is Shannon Park, and I am currently a second-year MPH student at Columbia University, majoring in Environmental Health Sciences with Applied Biostatistics specialization. 

<Current projects>

I’m currently working at Columbia Children's Environmental Health Cencer with Prof. Julie Herbstman on a project to investigate the association between prenatal and early childhood exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE)—a commonly used flame retardant—on executive function during adolescence. 

Also, I'm starting my master thesis research with Prof. Markus Hilpert for the project "The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on New York State Ambient Air Quality". It aims to see the change in air pollution (PM2.5, NO2, and O3) in New York State along different lockdown phase.
